Hi there! Iâ€™m a cybersecurity major interested in OSINT, Ethical Hacking, and Security Awareness. I aim to spread awareness about cyber threats and scams that could impact individuals and organizations. 


 In my spare time, I am dedicated to enhancing my current skillset and knowledge by participating in CTF platforms and competitions and completing online courses. I also enjoy building computers and coding in Python.
